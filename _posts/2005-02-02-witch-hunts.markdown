<p>Salon.com has a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.salon.com&#47;books&#47;review&#47;2005&#47;02&#47;01&#47;witch_craze&#47;index.html">really interesting story<&#47;a> about witch-hunts in Europe. The point is that it was not the evil church (nor evil churches, Protestants were involved as well as Catholics) who were the sole culprits, but <i>just plain folks<&#47;i>.</p>
<p>I used to subscribe to salon but went off it when it turned almost completely political. The best of salon used to be the briliantly-named <i>Mothers who think<&#47;i> section, now blandly named <i>Life<&#47;i>.</p>
