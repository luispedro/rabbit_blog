<p>I saw a mention to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Broken_window_fallacy">Broken Window Fallacy<&#47;a> (not Guiliani's Broken Windows), which I didn't know about. I looked it up, read up on it author, a 19th century French <i>laissez faire<&#47;i> economist by the name of Bastiat.</p>
<p>It is incredible how current his writings seem. Though, we would probably opt for another metaphor, his <a href="http:&#47;&#47;bastiat.org&#47;en&#47;petition.html">Petition<&#47;a>  (dated 1845) could have been written today responding to protectionist calls against <i>unfair competition<&#47;i> from China.</p>
