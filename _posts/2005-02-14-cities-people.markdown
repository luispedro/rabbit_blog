<p>I think about moving away from Lisbon, to another city, another country, to America.</p>
<p>What will I miss?</p>
<p>I am more afraid of missing Lisbon, the city, than anyone in it.</p>
<p>I can imagine not seeing anyone I know here again, but it seems harder to imagine not seeing the castle from Gra&Atilde;&sect;a with the sun going down.</p>
<p>As if the people are more easily replaceable than cities.</p>
