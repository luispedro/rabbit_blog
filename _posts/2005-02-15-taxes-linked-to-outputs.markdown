<p>Europe seems about to consider <a href="http:&#47;&#47;news.airwise.com&#47;story&#47;view&#47;1108410592.html">passing a tax on airline jet fuel<&#47;a> to <cite>help finance developing countries<&#47;cite>.</p>
<p>Taxes serve two different (but interwined) purposes: as regulation (by penalising the activity being taxed) and as a money-raising mechanism for the state. General value-added and Revenue taxes are money-raisers and, in principle, clean in the sense that they do not favour one activity over another creating distortions. Specific taxes such as taxes on kerosene are heavilly regulatory.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it might make sense to link the use of the money collected by a specific task to a specific end. For example, one could think that gas taxes would be reserved for road repaired. If road repair got more expensive, the state would raise fuel taxes, so passing on the costs to those who most use the roads and at the same time, making people use the roads less bringing down the cost of maintaining the roads.</p>
<p>Most of the times, however, it is pure nonsense to link a specific tax to a specific outcome. This seems to be common in the US, less so in Europe, unless you count the miriad protections to specific industries (like the Common Agricultural Policy, which can be partially seen as a tax on food products for the benefit of big landowners).</p>
<p>Now, enter the <i>let's save the world<&#47;i> taxes. The poorly-understood <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Tobin_tax">Tobin Tax<&#47;a> (which was proposed as a regulation mechanism and <strong>not as means to raise money<&#47;strong>) and now this, Chirac inspired kerosene tax.</p>
<p>Why is this bad?</p>
<p>For one, it makes the debate very difficult.How can one speak against a tax to raise money for developing countries? Doesn't one care about the world's poor?</p>
<p>But most of all, it doesn't really make sense. It obscures the debate. If the European Union wants to give money to developing countries, then it should go ahead and do it out of the general tax revenues. Maybe raising member countries contribution to the EU budget or reducing intra-EU aid.</p>
<p>Of course, if the EU wanted to <em>help<&#47;em> the poor instead of just spending money on them, it could, for example, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.oxfam.org&#47;eng&#47;programs_camp_mtf.htm">stop dumping its agricultural products on them<&#47;a>.</p>
