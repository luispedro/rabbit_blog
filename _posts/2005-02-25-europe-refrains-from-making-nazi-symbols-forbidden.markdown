<p>Hooray!</p>
<p>This is something to celebrate,</p>
<ol>
<li>Because free-speech means letting others say horrible things and I believe in free speech.<&#47;li>
<li>Because it would be contra-productive. Vitimization is a great motivator.<&#47;li>
<li>Because it would be just one <em>symbol of violence<&#47;em> to be prohibited. Neither the communist hack-and-cross, nor any of the other thousands of symbols in whose name horrible crimes were committed (almost any religious symbol, from almost any religion falls into this category) be prohibited.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
