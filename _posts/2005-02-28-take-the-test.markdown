<p>I was trying to define myself politically yesterday and struggling, so today I took a more structured approach (I don't think scientific applies, though) and went to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.politicalcompass.org&#47;">political compass<&#47;a> and took the test.</p>
<p>Here are the results:</p>
<p><center><br />
<img src="wp-content&#47;political-compass.png" alt="Political Compass Standing" &#47;><br />
<&#47;center></p>
<p>This puts me near the Dalay Lama and near Portugal's Prime-Minister Elect <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.publico.clix.pt&#47;sites&#47;bussola&#47;files&#47;resultadosCandidatos.htm">Jos&Atilde;&copy; S&Atilde;&sup3;crates<&#47;a>. I always did like him (and voted for him with conviction). Now I can explain why with graphs and maybe even do a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.norvig.com&#47;Gettysburg&#47;">PowerPoint presentation on the subject<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Note to .pt readers: P&Atilde;&ordm;blico has a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.publico.clix.pt&#47;sites&#47;bussola&#47;default.htm">Portuguese translation<&#47;a> of the above test.</p>
