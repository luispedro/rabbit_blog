<p>Anectode from Soviet Times (I don't know the origin or truth value of this):</p>
<blockquote><p>
An Western visitor to Russia enjoys the company of a Russian friend and they discuss politics. The western man is very impressed by the other's knowledge of the world and asks him where he learned all that. <i>Why, I read the <b>Pravda<&#47;b><&#47;i> replies the Russian man. <i>Oh, but I thought the <b>Pravda<&#47;b> was all propaganda and untruths<&#47;i>, says the western man.</p>
<p><i>It is, but you have to know how to read it.<&#47;i><br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Have we, in Western Democracies forgotten how to read the <i>Pravda<&#47;i>?</p>
<p>I think of how and why the American Press differs so much from the European one. In no country is there any real censorship. Britain's libel laws, French censorship of Al-Manar, German prohibition of neo-Nazi discourse are all examples of state meddling with free speech, sure, but not really relevant in this context.</p>
<p>The classical example is, of course, Palestinian attacks which do not show up in the news here and Israelian raids which do not show up in the US.</p>
<p>But, while the Oil-For-Food scandal raged in the US, European newspapers only mentioned in passing the Volcker Report and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.washtimes.com&#47;world&#47;20050215-123622-9532r.htm">Kojo Annan<&#47;a>'s name never showed up.</p>
<p>Also, I am yet to see a mention to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.washingtonpost.com&#47;ac2&#47;wp-dyn&#47;A45575-2005Feb22">Walid Jumblatt's Washington Post's<&#47;a> interview where he (a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Druze">Druze<&#47;a> leader) says that the Iraqi elections were <cite>the start of a new Arab World<&#47;cite>.</p>
<p>It is obvious why the European press under-reported on this and obvious why the US one over-reported. Europe is against the Iraqi invasion, so it's bad to report any support for it and a UN scandal is just not what we need when we want to put the UN as an alternative to US hegemony.</p>
<p>Vice-versa for the overplaying of the comments of an hireto underof Druze leader (very few people in the general population know or care about who the Druze are and what they think) and of the yet-unproven alegations against the Annan Family.</p>
<p>There is no conspiracy, just the small decisions taken by the hundreds of individual editors, reporters and news-consumers. I won't write much on this, for fear of falling into post-modernism.</p>
<p>The dangerous thing is a belief in impartiality. As someone said, <cite>there is no such thing as impartial journalism, only honest one<&#47;cite>.</p>
