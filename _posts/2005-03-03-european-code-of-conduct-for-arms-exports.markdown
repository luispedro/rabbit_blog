<p>The EU is thinking about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;news.bbc.co.uk&#47;2&#47;hi&#47;europe&#47;4288067.stm">lifting its arms export ban on China<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Especially France is very keen on this. Not because it wants a <i>multiplural world<&#47;i>, as Chirac says, nor just to make a point to the Americans, but because it's such good business. Although certain type of European weaponery are world-class (even the American Army uses some), other, such as the Mirage fighters, do not really stand a chance against American exports, except in countries who are embargoed by the US. France can only really sell them to the bad guys. Everyone else, buys F16s.</p>
<p>But, says the EU, we have a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;projects.sipri.se&#47;expcon&#47;eucode.htm">Code of Conduct<&#47;a>. This Code says things like <i>weapons cannot be exported if they are to be used for internal repression<&#47;i> or that they shall not be sold to countries which have <i>a claim against the territory of a neighbouring country which the recipient has in the past tried or threatened to pursue by means of force<&#47;i> (is Tawain considered a country, for the above purpose?) or that <i>Member States will not allow exports which would provoke or prolong armed conflicts<&#47;i>.</p>
<p>Isn't this a bit too rosy?<br />
The code mostly rules out everyone on the planet.<br />
Which means, of course, it won't be followed, its restriction will be <i>eurofudged away<&#47;i>.</p>
