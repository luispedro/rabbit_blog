<p>First a couple of definitions:</p>
<p>A progressive tax is one where richer people pay a bigger share of their income. Income taxes are normally progressive (richer people have higher rates).</p>
<p>A regressive tax is one where richer people pay less. Sales or Value-Added Tax is normally regressive because richer people spend a lesser part of their income on products.</p>
<p>Normally, a progressive system is desired and laws strive, in one way or another, to reach it. Very often however, the current tax systems are progressive in form, but regressive in practice. One of the bigger reasons, I believe, is the complexity of the tax code.</p>
<p>A lot of tax laws are progressive in intent in that they provide tax breaks which would benefit lower-income individuals. However, it is richer people who take advantage of these, since they are the ones who can afford professional counseling to, or are simply the ones who care to look and have the ability to find these types of breaks.</p>
<p>A lot of progressive measures result in a regressive system.</p>
