<p>In my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;luispedro.org&#47;blog&#47;?p=40">previous post<&#47;a> I only reached the conclusion that <cite>people do care more about their own kind<&#47;cite> without coming to the question of its value as a policy justification.</p>
<p>In Don Broudeaux's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;cafehayek.typepad.com&#47;hayek&#47;2005&#47;03&#47;bravo_for_the_a.html">opinion<&#47;a>, this is unjustified as bigotry. Furthermore, it is unjustified because it infringes on one personal liberty (the classical liberal argument).</p>
<p>Allow me to disagree on the reasoning and arrive at the same conclusion.</p>
<p>First of all, let me remark again on how protectinist schemes often hurt everybody, including those I have been calling the poor-rich (poor people in rich countries). The reduced access to cheaper products works like a regressive tax. This doesn't address the legitmacy issue, though.</p>
<p>The state, being in Max Weber's definition, <cite>the monopoly holder of legitimate force<&#47;cite> is a necessary entity to solve free-rider issues which arise in several benefitial protection schemes. The state is there to force you to contribute (the portuguese word for tax <cite>imposto<&#47;cite>, as its french counter part <cite>imp&Atilde;&acute;t<&#47;cite>, means literally <cite>imposed<&#47;cite>).</p>
<p>It is tempting to draw a line between <i>contribution schemes<&#47;i> which are tax supported and <i>protectionist schemes<&#47;i>. There is a good argument in favour of this which is the <cite>obscurity argument<&#47;cite>. If the state subsidises a struggling company from the general tax collection, at least it is clear how much it directly costs the tax payers (indirect costs in reduced access to cheaper products are still a problem), while an import quota scheme is much harder to quantify.</p>
<p>Still, this still doesn't address the legitmacy issue. On liberal grounds, it is flimsy. After all, what is the difference from an individual's point of view if he is forced to pay more because of a sales tax or because of an import quota?</p>
<p>The real distinction, I have come to believe is this: if tomorrow unemployement benefits in France were to disappear, would the poor in rural Brazil notice? Not really, I think. They would notice it however, if the French were to suddenly allow them to sell their sugar in equal terms.</p>
<p>The ilegitmacy of protectionist systems is that they <strong>hurt the poor-poor<&#47;strong> while other <i>imposed-contribution<&#47;i> schemes do not. They are exclusive to the nationals of the country and do not help foreigns (Morocans can't access the Spanish unemployement benefits, of course), but they do not <em>actively hurt foreigns<&#47;em>. Protectionism does.</p>
<p>That's why Brazil's President Lula has said that <cite>reforming the Common Agricultural Policy was his <strong>number one<&#47;strong> foreign policy objective<&#47;cite> and got the backing of other third world countries (the so called <cite>Group of Twenty<&#47;cite>). </p>
