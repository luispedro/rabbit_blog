<p>I had written <a href="http:&#47;&#47;luispedro.org&#47;blog&#47;?p=34">earlier<&#47;a> on the poor-poor and poor-rich. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;luispedro.org&#47;blog&#47;?p=36">Later<&#47;a>, I added that the poor-poor were often screwed in the <i>name of the poor-rich<&#47;i>, but these did not really profit.</p>
<p>In particular (for non .pt readers), I gave as an example, the Common Agricultural Policy's import restriction which can be seen as a doubly regressive tax: first, by raising food prices, it hurts the poor more than the rich (since it matters more to them) and secondly, it gives that money to the rich landowners (to all landowners, of course, but the more land you have, the more you get). I also remarked that raising fresh produce prices is a bad health policy (it lowers consumption of healthy foods).</p>
<p>Today, there is on, Caf&Atilde;&copy; Hayek, an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;cafehayek.typepad.com&#47;hayek&#47;2005&#47;03&#47;bravo_for_the_a.html">a further argument<&#47;a> along these lines. It argues that putting unknown strangers with the same skin colour as your own above unknown strangers with a different skin colour is imoral.</p>
<p>Although very few people have the candour of Danish nationalists who say <cite>we are racists in order to protect the European Social Model<&#47;cite>, most do protect their own kind first. It is difficult to say what <i>their own kind<&#47;i> is. Language, skin-colour, common heritage, cultural identification are all factors.</p>
<p>There are studies linking percentage of blacks to state-welfare systems in different states in the US which show that whiter states have more welfare. Presumably, people in mixed states don't want to share as much. In Europe, there is almost no inter-state sharing going on. The EU budget is about 1% of GDP.</p>
<p>People do care more about strangers who speak their own language and have the same skin colour.</p>
