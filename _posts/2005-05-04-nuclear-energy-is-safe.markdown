<p>I might be persuaded that nuclear power is a safe, low-cost, no-emission alternative source to fossil fuels (I still doubt that most favorable estimates are adding in the costs of storing nuclear waste for the next hundred thousand years, but I could be persuaded), but I can never believe that nuclear power is <strong>secure<&#47;strong>.  There is an important difference between <cite>safety<&#47;cite> and <cite>security<&#47;cite>. Some other languages don't have this, so allow me to make the distinction: <em>Safety is protection against Murphy; Security is protection against Machiavelly.<&#47;em> Very often, safety and security conflict and security reduces safety. For example, having more doors to a building improves safety in case of emergency, but make for more entry points for <em>bad guys<&#47;em>.</p>
<p>Back to the nuclear plant: A shoulder-fired missile, a hijacked airplane, a suicide bomber, a suicide truck-driver with an explosive-laden vehicle (think <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;1983_Beirut_barracks_bombing">Beirut<&#47;a>, not <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cnn.com&#47;US&#47;OKC&#47;bombing.html">Oklahoma<&#47;a>), all would have a more than terrifying chance of making large portions of a country inhabitable (something the size of Ireland). Until I see a satisfactory explanation on how to deal with these issues, I don't think one needs to even discuss whether it is cost-effective.</p>
