<blockquote><p>
[Maize] cannot reproduce on its own, human beings must sow the species.<br />
...<br />
Maize's closest relative is a mountain grass called teosinte that looks nothing like it.<br />
...<br />
The modern species [of maize] had to have been consciously developed by a small group of breeders who hunted through teosinte strands for plants with desired traits.<br />
...<br />
Geneticists from Rutgers University...estimated in 1998 that determined, aggressive, plan breeders -- which Indians certainly were -- might have been able to breed maize in as little as a decade...modern maize was the outcome of a bold act of conscious biological manipulation -- "arguably man's first, and perhaps his greatest, feat of genetic engineering," [Nina Federoff]..."To get corn out of teosinte is so -- you couldn't get a grant to do that now, because it would sound so crazy...Somebody who did that today would get a Nobel Prize!  If their lab didn't get shut down by Greenpeace, I mean.<br />
