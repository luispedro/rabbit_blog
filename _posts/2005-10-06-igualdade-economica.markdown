<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <cite>quando eu f&Atilde;&acute;r grande quero ser como o Rui Ramos<&#47;cite>:</p>
<p>Tirado de <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0521336112&#47;">The Importance of What we Care About<&#47;a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
To the extent that people are preoccupied with equality for its own sake, their readiness to be satisfied with any particular level of income or wealth is guided not by their own interests and needs but just by the magnitude of the economic benefits that are at the disposal of others. In this way egalitarianism distracts people from measuring the requirements to which their individual natures and their personal circumstances give rise. It encourages them instead to insist upon a level of economic support that is determined by a calculation in which the particular features of their own lives are irrelevant. How sizeable the economic assets of others are has nothing to do, after all, with what kind of person someone is. A concern for economic equality, construed as desirable in-itself, tends to divert a person's attention away from endeavouring to discover --- within his experience of himself and of his life --- what he himself really cares about and what will actually satisfy him, although this is the most basic and the most decisive task upon which an intelligent selection of economic goals depends. Exaggerating the moral importance of economic equality is harmful, in other words, because it is alienating.<br />
