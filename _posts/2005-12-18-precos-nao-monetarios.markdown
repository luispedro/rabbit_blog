<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <i>a economia tem pouco a ver com dinheiro<&#47;i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Many [people] assume that only if and when drivers are charged tolls to access roads is there a price paid to use roads.  These readers ignore the fact that spending time on traffic-choked 'free' roads is itself a very real cost, and that tolls will reduce this cost.</p>
<p>[...] economists are the last people who are obsessed with prices --- the last people who believe that the only things that matter are money and costs expressed in money.  Rather, it's non-economists who are obsessed with money measures and money prices; it's non-economists who are most prone to overlook costs that aren't pecuniary --- to assume that only when people make monetary outlays do people incur costs.<br />
