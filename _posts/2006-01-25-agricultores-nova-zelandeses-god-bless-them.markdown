<p>1. Deixaram de <a href="http:&#47;&#47;news.bbc.co.uk&#47;2&#47;hi&#47;programmes&#47;from_our_own_correspondent&#47;3747430.stm">recebem subs&Atilde;&shy;dios<&#47;a> (e est&Atilde;&pound;o melhores que nunca):</p>
<blockquote><p>
The removal [of subsidies], far from destroying New Zealand agriculture, appears to have re-energised it. Agriculture contributes slightly more now to the total economy than it did in the era of subsidies and there is plenty of evidence the land is being farmed more creatively. </p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>    I met several younger farmers like Bevan and Caroline who could barely get their heads round what subsidies were!  </p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p> And the farmers themselves?  Well I did not meet a single one who wanted to go back to subsidies.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Well, 20 years on, far from [damaging] New Zealand's farmers, the withdrawal of their subsidies turns out to have revived them. It has restored the "pioneer spirit", I was told on more than one occasion, that helped our great-grandparents build the country.<br />

Neste <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.economist.com&#47;world&#47;asia&#47;displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_VQNVSQT">artigo<&#47;a> do Economist (<i>sorry<&#47;i>, linque pago), relata-se a luta actual dos agricultores para manterem os seus direitos de propriedade contra as incurs&Atilde;&micro;es do Estado que quer consagrar direitos de passagem, cortar nos direitos de constru&Atilde;&sect;&Atilde;&pound;o, e, no geral, alterar o regime de propriedade:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Many farmers feel they are being asked to shoulder the burden.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Mr Kelly and his fellow-farmers understand the desire to protect beauty. The back view from his farm is stunning and includes the Haureki Gulf, Coromandel Peninsula and Auckland's harbour. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I can see why people want it,&acirc;&euro; he sighs. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;But if you want it, then buy it or lease it.&acirc;&euro;<br />

<p>Viva os agricultores da Nova Zel&Atilde;&cent;ndia!</p>
