<p>Lembrei desta <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.reason.com&#47;0508&#47;fe.sd.the.shtml">entrevista<&#47;a> com Salman Rushdie na revista <cite>Reason<&#47;cite> (que, infelizmente, n&Atilde;&pound;o se encontra em Lisboa, nem a fabulosa Papelaria Tema a vende).</p>
<p>Excertos:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I suppose I became more intellectually engaged in the subject of freedom [after the <i>fatwa<&#47;i>]. If you live in free countries you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have to spend all your life arguing about freedom because it is all around you. It seems redundant to make a lot of noise about something when, in fact, there it is. But if someone tries to remove it, it becomes important for you to formulate your own defenses of it.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The thing I feared most after the fatwa was that there were a number of ways my writing could be derailed by that attack. In a literary sense, I was afraid I would write much more cautious books. Or alternatively, that I would become embittered and write more hostile books. </p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Of course, there is nothing intrinsic linking any religion with any act of violence. The crusades don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t prove that Christianity was violent. The Inquisition doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t prove that Christianity tortures people. But <em>that<&#47;em> Christianity did torture people. <em>This<&#47;em> Islam did carry out this attack [September 11].</p>
<p>     I think there is a desire, for virtuous reasons, to make this disassociation. You can respect those reasons, but there is a problem of truth.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>There is an actually existing Islam which is not at all likeable.</p>
<p>     There may well be another alternative. I grew up in a Muslim family in India, and I know what is meant by that other Islam. My grandfather was a very religious man. He went to Mecca for the Hajj and prayed five times a day. Yet he was the most tolerant and open person I ever met. If you go into any Muslim country, you will find that dispute between radical Islam and moderate Islam. It is not a question of how the West perceives the East, but of what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s happening inside the East. If you go to Muslims in India, they can tell you immediately about that battle with those other Muslims. For example, the kind of Islam that is being forced on Kashmir is very much a kind of Arabist Islam, which is alien to Kashmir. It is not liked by Kashmiris, who have a more Sufistic tradition, which is much more mystical and much milder.<br />
