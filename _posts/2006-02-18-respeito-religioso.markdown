<p>O respeito cultural &Atilde;&copy; isto?</p>
<p>Uma marcha <cite>gay pride<&#47;cite> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;news.independent.co.uk&#47;europe&#47;article345947.ece">foi cancelada<&#47;a></p>
<blockquote><p>
Earlier this week Chief Mufti Talgat Tadzhuddin warned that Russia's Muslims would stage violent protests if the march went ahead. "If they come out on to the streets anyway they should be flogged. Any normal person would do that - Muslims and Orthodox Christians alike ... [The protests] might be even more intense than protests abroad against those controversial cartoons." The cleric said the Koran taught that homosexuals should be killed because their lifestyle spells the extinction of the human race and said that gays had no human rights.</p>
<p>The Russian Orthodox Church has called it "the propaganda of sin". Bishop Daniil of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk yesterday condemned the plans as a "cynical mockery" and likened homosexuality to leprosy.<br />

<blockquote><p>
Notice this is not al Qaeda. It is the official mainstream Muslim leadership [at least one of the main Russian Muslim organizations --- LPC]. Bob Wright today makes the case for self-censorship to avoid offense to religious groups and others. In principle, this makes sense. Gratuitous, arbitrary offense of someone else's faith is not a laudable exercize of free speech. It's an abuse of such freedom. But context is vital. Bob cites an example of portraying Jesus with a crown of thorns made up of dynamite sticks, after an abortion clinic bombing. I'd say that's a perfectly legitimate comment after an act of violence performed in the name of a religious figure who preached non-violence.<br />
