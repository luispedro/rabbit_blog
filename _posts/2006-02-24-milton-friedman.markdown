<p>Nesta <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.digitalnpq.org&#47;archive&#47;2006_winter&#47;friedman.html">entrevista<&#47;a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 The great virtue of a free market is that it enables people who hate each other, or who are from vastly different religious or ethnic backgrounds, to cooperate economically. Government intervention can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do that. Politics exacerbates and magnifies differences.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>[Regarding inequality], in the US, the problem now is primary and secondary education. We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve had such an increase in inequality because a quarter of American kids don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t finish high school! In the current world, with the skills needed, those dropouts are condemned to being members of the underclass. In my view, this is a fault of the American school system, which is a government monopoly.<br />
