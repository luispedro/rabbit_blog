<blockquote><p>
A decade and a half after Nirvana's success exposed the strength of secular alt-culture tribes, their evangelical counterparts are having their own coming out in rebel gestures that sometimes recall the early church, sometimes ... well, early Nirvana.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Part of being a counterculture, Mr. Mitchell said, means working to counter some of the values that get mass marketed as rebellion, including the Big Three of the old counterculture: sex, drugs and the commercial trappings of rock 'n' roll.</p>
<p>"I got into punk," Mr. Mitchell said, "because it was saying things that other people weren't saying" - thumbing its nose at "the man." He continued: "Now there is no man. You've got Jay-Z and Donald Trump all on the same team. There's no point being countercultural if those are the alternatives.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>There is a contradiction perhaps in evangelicals adopting the stance of the rebel outsider at a time when they have more influence and visibility than they have had in generations. But the same was true of radical youths in the 1960's counterculture, who were more affluent and numerically strong than any generation before them.</p>
<p>Dr. Smith compared the romance of rebellion to the middle-class fascination with hip-hop culture. "Spoiled suburban white kids act like rappers, and there is a real connection to something, but really it's not what their lives are fundamentally about," he said. "Their lives are about wanting to go to Duke University."<br />
