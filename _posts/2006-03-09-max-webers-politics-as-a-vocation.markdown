<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <i>devia ser dado na escola<&#47;i>:</p>
<p>Devia ser lido na escola:</p>
<p>Max Weber's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ne.jp&#47;asahi&#47;moriyuki&#47;abukuma&#47;weber&#47;lecture&#47;politics_vocation.html">Politics as a Vocation<&#47;a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must be clear about the fact that all ethically oriented conduct may be guided by one of two fundamentally differing and irreconcilably opposed maxims: conduct can be oriented to an <em>ethic of posture<&#47;em> or to an <em>ethic of responsibility<&#47;em>. This is not to say that an ethic of posture is identical with irresponsibility, or that an ethic of responsibility is identical with unprincipled opportunism. Naturally nobody says that. However, there is an abysmal contrast between conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of posture--that is, in religious terms, <cite>The Christian does rightly and leaves the results with the Lord<&#47;cite>--and conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of responsibility, in which case one has to give an account of the foreseeable results of one's action.<br />
<&#47;p>
<p>You may demonstrate to a convinced syndicalist, believing in an ethic of posture, that his action will result in increasing the opportunities of reaction, in increasing the oppression of his class, and obstructing its ascent--and you will not make the slightest impression upon him. If an action of good intent leads to bad results, then, in the actor's eyes, not he but the world, or the stupidity of other men, or God's will who made them thus, is responsible for the evil. However a man who believes in an ethic of responsibility takes account of precisely the average deficiencies of people; as Fichte has correctly said, he does not even have the right to presuppose their goodness and perfection. He does not feel in a position to burden others with the results of his own actions so far as he was able to foresee them; he will say: these results are ascribed to my action. The believer in an ethic of posture feels <em>responsible<&#47;em> only for seeing to it that the flame of pure intentions is not quenched: for example, the flame of protesting against the injustice of the social order. To rekindle the flame ever anew is the purpose of his quite irrational deeds, judged in view of their possible success. They are acts that can and shall have only exemplary value. </p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Everything that is striven for through political action operating with violent means and following an ethic of responsibility endangers the <em>salvation of the soul<&#47;em>. If, however, one chases after the ultimate good in a war of beliefs, following a pure ethic of absolute ends, then the goals may be damaged and discredited for generations, because responsibility for consequences is lacking, and two diabolic forces which enter the play remain unknown to the actor. These are inexorable and produce consequences for his action and even for his inner self, to which he must helplessly submit, unless he perceives them. The sentence: 'The devil is old; grow old to understand him!' does not refer to age in terms of chronological years. I have never permitted myself to lose out in a discussion through a reference to a date registered on a birth certificate; but the mere fact that someone is twenty years of age and that I am over fifty is no cause for me to think that this alone is an achievement before which I am overawed.<br />

<p>Em rela&Atilde;&sect;&Atilde;&pound;o ao texto acima substitu&Atilde;&shy; <cite>ethic of ultimate ends<&#47;cite> por <cite>ethic of posture<&#47;cite> porque me parece mais pr&Atilde;&sup3;ximo do <cite>Gesinnungsethik<&#47;cite> do <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.textlog.de&#47;2296.html">original<&#47;a> (sobretudo para um latino para quem ultimate n&Atilde;&pound;o tem a mesma carga religiosa).
