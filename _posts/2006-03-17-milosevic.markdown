Determined petitioners, demand Mr Milosevic's release and the jailing of "the real war criminals: the Nato leaders who committed crimes against humanity and against Yugoslav sovereignty and who continue to commit those crimes today". One of their signatories was the new Nobel laureate for literature, Harold Pinter, though somehow this fact was left off the citation. </p>
<p>All that remains for them to do is to spread as many rumours as they can that the forces of imperialism done the old boy in, and then they can get down to the business of pre-emptively defending Kim Jong Il, or posthumously rehabilitating Beria, or something useful like that.<br />

<blockquote><p>
Then came Srebrenica. Of course there was plenty of reason, even before July 1995, to doubt that diplomacy could save hundreds of thousands from ethnic cleansing and murder. But Srebrenica was the moment when our responsibility for all this simply could not be denied. The UN was there, in the form of Dutch soldiers supposedly protecting an enclave. Our cameras were there as Ratko Mladic swanned into the invaded town and smilingly reassured Bosnian women that everything would be dealt with. In front of our eyes, just about, with our full knowledge, thousands were taken to European fields - just as they had been 50 years earlier - and murdered en masse. It was the most shaming moment of my life. We had let it happen again.<br />
