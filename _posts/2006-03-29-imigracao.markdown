That said, I take seriously the argument that there is a limit to how much immigration we can accept at a given time. By some estimates I've heard, as many as 60% of Mexicans say that they would immigrate here if they could. This would create a ring of poverty around our cities that Americans would find unacceptable. But that's really an aesthetic argument; it's hard to give it moral force, when you consider that all those poor people would be living there because it's even worse at home.</p>
<p>I think the real limit to the number of immigrants we can accept is the rate at which America's institutions can assimilate them.<br />
"Institutions" is the new buzzword in economics, and like all such buzzwords, it gets bandied around somewhat loosely. By "instititutions" I mean, in this case, all the hidden cultural practices that allow us to transact with strangers with such a high degree of trust and efficiency. If, for example, we allowed so many immigrants that one could no longer effectively be sure of transacting business in a single language, that would have heavy institutional costs. Or if most of the immigrants came from places where family networks were the primary economic unit, and nepotism was viewed as a cultural good, and there were enough of them to change the practice in large swathes of American business, I think that this would make both immigrants and the Americans worse off. Or if there were enough immigrants with anti-liberal (in the classical sense) values to undermine that cultural feature of America, that would be, I think, a bad thing for everyone.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>But aside from vulgar nationalism ...in which, I confess, I often indulge myself... I can't see a good reason for caring about them more than millions who live in really desperate poverty to our south.<br />
