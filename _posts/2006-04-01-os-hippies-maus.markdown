<p>Fant&Atilde;&iexcl;stico <a href="http:&#47;&#47;petty-larseny.blogspot.com&#47;2005&#47;10&#47;bush-and-cheney-hippie-kings_20.html">sobre os hippies maus<&#47;a> (como o Bush). Vale a pena ler na &Atilde;&shy;ntegra, mas aqui fica um exerpto:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The ethos of the early Hippie was expressed in such slogans as <cite>Turn on, tune in, drop out<&#47;cite>, <cite>To live outside the law, you must be honest<&#47;cite>,and <cite>If it feels good, do it<&#47;cite>. Repeated transmission of the hippie code revealed rejection of the government's laws as a dominant gene, while almost no one inherited the recessive trait that obliged its carriers to adopt the code's moral burdens. And, <cite>To live outside the law, you must be honest<&#47;cite>, was seen as a simple urging to live outside the law, instead of what it was: A caveat that those who reject prevailing law must in that moral vacuum become even more scrupulous, and develop their own, more-exacting code.</p>
<p>From this replication error, the Utopian Intellectual Hippie swiftly gave way to the Hedonistic Drug-Addled Hippie, and its sub-species (marked by high rates of amoral ambition): The Evil Hippie. The Evil Hippie's codes: <em>Turn on, drop out, Live outside the law, Do it<&#47;em>.</p>
<p>George Bush and Dick Cheney are Evil Hippies.<br />
