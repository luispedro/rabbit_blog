<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <i>isto j&Atilde;&iexcl; parece um blogue<&#47;i>:</p>
<p>Excelente ideia (lottery savings tickets):</p>
<blockquote><p>
Some 20 million Americans spend at least $1,000 a year on lottery tickets.<br />
[...]<br />
A lottery savings ticket would look just like a lotto ticket, scratch like a lotto ticket, cost a buck and pay out the same prizes. The only difference would be that half the revenue would be earmarked for a personal retirement savings account rather than for education. There would still be about a third for prizes and the remainder for administering the game. </p>
<p>Setting up a personal retirement account would be no more difficult than setting up a mutual fund. Players would receive a swipeable card that would automatically credit a portion of each losing ticket to the player's retirement account...<br />
[...]<br />
For heavy purchasers the new tickets would increase their personal savings by $500 a year. Invested over 40 years, these savings tickets would generate an expected retirement nest egg of $200,000. This is a lot of money for the mostly not very prosperous crowd who buy lottery tickets every week.<br />

<p>Subscrevo ainda o coment&Atilde;&iexcl;rio do Alex Tabarrok:</p>
<blockquote><p>
It is incredible that many poor people spend more on lottery tickets than on retirement.  My non-bleeding heart libertarian friend would point out that this shows how much poverty is due to irresponsibility and he would probably be right.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Adam Smith said the goal of social policy is to create institutions like the market that channel self-interest in ways that redound to the social interest. Call me a libertarian paternalist, if you must, but I like how lottery savings tickets channel failures of reason and prudence in ways that redound to the individual's self-interest.<br />
