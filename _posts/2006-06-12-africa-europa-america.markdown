<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <i>isto j&Atilde;&iexcl; parece um blogue liberal<&#47;i>:</p>
<p>Tirado do <a href="http:&#47;&#47;commentisfree.guardian.co.uk&#47;david_boaz&#47;2006&#47;05&#47;african_immigration_to_america.html">Guardian<&#47;a> (via <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.johannorberg.net&#47;?page=displayblog&month=5&year=2006#1699">Johan Norberg<&#47;a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>
This young immigrant just may have told us everything we need to know about Africa, the United States, and maybe even Europe: Komi Akoumany grew up poor in West Africa and learned there were "three ways to become somebody: Your father is head of a military branch or knows the president, you are gifted with extreme soccer skills that will catch the eyes of European soccer coaches, or you get on a plane to United States of America."</p>
<p>He's been in the United States for six years now, and he's headed to college.<br />
