<blockquote><p>
One's belief that voluntarily chosen homosexual acts are wrong, should be viewed similar to one's belief that voluntarily flouting Kosher norms, or eating pork is wrong. We don't consider a Jew who believes it's wrong to violate Kosher to be bigoted against those who don't follow the Kosher diet. Similarly, we don't consider Muslims who believe it's wrong to eat pork to be bigoted against pork-eaters. </p>
<p>However, in a liberal pluralistic society, we do expect these devoutly held religious convictions to be consigned to the realm of individual private conviction and not written into public policy. And that, it seems to me, is the compromise: If you believe homosexual acts are wrong based on devoutly held religious convictions, you are not a bigot and those beliefs deserve respect as private convictions. But they are not a respectable basis for public policy any more than we would accept writing Kosher or Sharia into law without further public reason.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The bottom line is, if we can grant rights to other religions like Hindus and not feel as though this violates our orthodox religious convictions, we can likewise grant rights to homosexuals. And, in turn, we can at the same time respect individuals' devoutly held convictions that homosexual acts are immoral, that holding such doesn't make one a bigot, as long as those convictions stay in the realm of private conscience, much like a Jew's religious duty to eat Kosher exists solely within the realm of private conviction and not as public policy. Remember, in illiberal Islam, where they draw no distinction between Church and State, they do write their dietary restrictions into public law (as well as, of course, Biblical prohibitions on homosexual sex and worshipping false Gods).</p>
<p>The liberal democratic West does things differently.<br />
