<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <i>mais uma raz&Atilde;&pound;o para comprar o <&#47;i>Economist (a Jane McArdle do janegalt.net escreve no economist):</p>
<blockquote><p>
If I argue with a creationist about the age of the earth, he could say that I--not having done the scientific research myself--am just making an "argument from authority", and that there's no reason to privilege the authority of the scientists over the authority of The Divine Architect. But while I think far too many people do believe in evolution for pretty much the same reason that fundamentalists believe in creationism--because their neighbours and parents and other authority figures told them it's so--that is not why I am accepting evolution over creationism. I am placing my bets on evolution because the scientific method seems to me to be a better way to find out the truth than searching for answers in a book written by some enterprising middle-eastern shepherds ca. 800 BCE.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>[That the economist tends to <i>liberal-conservative<&#47;i> is not] an indictment of the news organisation; it's the natural human tendency to find things more believable when they agree with what you already believe. Mr Farrell, I'd suggest, simply doesn't notice it in other papers because, well, they agree with him more, and hence he finds them more believable. The Economist is no less methodologically rigorous than any other paper anyone I know has written for; indeed, it is rather more rigorous than most about things like fact-checking. The difference is that The Economist states its opinions, rather than maintaining a facade of neutrality while slanting the article so that the readers come to the same conclusion that the reporter did. This, of course, is more irritating if you happen to disagree with the analysis, but it is not measurably more "objective". Indeed, Mr Farrell's criteria for "objective" seems to be "left wing", that being the ideological tenor of all the papers he cites, including those which, like the Wall Street Journal, are quite opinionated<br />
