<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <i>isto j&Atilde;&iexcl; parece um blogue<&#47;i>:</p>
<p>Pelo menos, a mim, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;hanson.gmu.edu&#47;BusinessWeek-7-3-06.htm">isto<&#47;a> soa-me (colagem de cita&Atilde;&sect;&Atilde;&micro;es, mais do que um excerto):</p>
<blockquote><p>
To succeed in academia, my graduate students and I had to learn to be less creative than we were initially inclined to be. Critics complain that schools squelch creativity, but most people are inclined to be more creative on the job than would be truly productive. So schooling is mostly about selecting the smarter and more diligent, and learning to show up day after day to somewhat boring jobs with ambiguous instructions.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: Innovation matters. But to get more innovation we may want less, not more, creativity.</p>
<p>Innovation is no more about releasing your inner bohemian than it is about holding hands, singing Kumbaya, and believing in innovation.<br />
