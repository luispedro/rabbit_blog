<p>Do <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.economist.com&#47;opinion&#47;displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_STTQQVG">economist<&#47;a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Defenders of state intervention argue that without it France would not have world-beaters in business, such as the two leading luxury-goods groups (LVMH and PPR), one of the biggest insurers (AXA), as well as leaders in cosmetics (L'Or&Atilde;&copy;al) and food (Danone). Mittal won because of a fragmented shareholder base interested only in making a quick buck, fumes Jean-Pierre Chev&Atilde;&uml;nement, a former socialist government minister.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>But there is a problem with the argument that state support produces world-beating companies. Successful French firms, such as L'Or&Atilde;&copy;al and AXA, tend to be the ones the state has left alone. The companies it backed were the ones that eventually needed rescuing: Alstom, an engineering group; Bull, a computer firm; Air France, the national airline; Cr&Atilde;&copy;dit Lyonnais, a big bank. A state guarantee allows managers to run companies irresponsibly without fear of being disciplined by shareholders or banks.<br />
