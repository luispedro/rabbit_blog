<p>Uma excelente defesa do mercado livre de <a href="http:&#47;&#47;video.google.com&#47;videoplay?docid=6813529239937418232&q=milton+friedman">milton friedman<&#47;a>. Antigo, mas perfeitamente inteligente e actual.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Interviewer: You are often identified by many as someone as someone who does not care for other, the poor and the needy especially.</p>
<p>MF: (...) One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions and goals rather than by their results ... Some people go around parroting the softness of their heart and I admire them for it, but often it extends to their head as well. In fact, all most programs presented by such high intentions get exactly the opposite results.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Can you give me an example?</p>
<p>MF: Almost all such programs are passed by a combination of special interests and na&Atilde;&macr;ve do-gooders ... The minimum wage law, which has done much harm to the needy .... Here the special interests are the labour unions while the do-gooders who support minimum wage are often unaware of the real effects. The law could be written as <cite>you must discriminate against low-skill workers<&#47;cite> and those are the ones who feel the ill effects. There is no more anti-negro law in the books today than the minimum wage law.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Interviewer: Why did we have, in the last decades, a movement towards colectivism and government control?</p>
<p>MF: (...) What I think that what needs to be explained is why we had a century without it. (...) You cannot find a date in history where the bulk of the human race was not living under a dictatorship, even right now. The exceptions are things like the early Greece (even though there is was mixed), the Renaissance in some ways and the nineteen century.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>MF: The argument for colectivism is simple: if there is a problem, pass a law, send the government. The argument for the free market is more subtle and is difficult to understand.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>MF: There are very good signs for our side: (...) the good ability of the people to find ways to go around laws and the wasteful nature of the government. If the government could spend the 45% of our income in an efficient fation, we would all be slaves now.<br />
