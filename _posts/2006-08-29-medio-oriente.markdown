<blockquote>History teaches that rise to power and responsibility affects deeply the nature of revolutionary parties. Experience and common sense were perfecly justified in expecting that totalitarianism in power would gradually lose its revolutionary momentum and utopian character, that the everyday business of government and possession of real power would moderate the pre-power claims of the movements and gradually destroy the fcticious world of their organizations [...].</p>

Contrary to all expectations, important concessions and greatly heightened international prestige did not help to reintegrate the totalitarian countries into the comity of nations or induce them to abandon the lying complaint that the whole world had lined up against them. And far from preventing this, diplomatic victories clearly precipitated their recourse to the instruments of violence and resulted in all instances in increased hostility against the powers that had shown themselves willing to compromise.<&#47;blockquote></p>
