<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <em>os melhores posts s&Atilde;&pound;o os roubados<&#47;em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.imdb.com&#47;title&#47;tt0060665&#47;">A Man For All Seasons<&#47;a>," by Robert Bolt [is a film] about St Thomas More's resistance to lawless executive power and the fusion of church and state in Henrician England. [...]</p>
<p>In the screenplay, Bolt gives us the classic debate about whether it is permissible [...] to break the law to pursue and defeat evil. The conversation is between the hot-headed future son-in-law Roper and one of the great lawyers of his time, More. More sticks up for legal procedures in every case. Roper objects.</p>
<p>Roper: So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law!</p>
<p>More: Yes.  What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?</p>
<p>Roper: I'd cut down every law in England to do that!</p>
<p>More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you - where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast - man's laws, not God's - and if you cut them down - and you're just the man to do it - d'you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.<&#47;blockquote><br />
Tirado ao <a href="http:&#47;&#47;time.blogs.com&#47;daily_dish&#47;2006&#47;05&#47;the_rule_of_law.html">Andrew Sullivan<&#47;a>, a quem tirei o contexto, n&Atilde;&pound;o porque n&Atilde;&pound;o concorde, mas porque penso que a cita&Atilde;&sect;&Atilde;&pound;o se aplica mais geralmente.</p>
