<p>Na serie <em>outras <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.blogger.com&#47;comment.g?blogID=11771399&postID=115817534385607779">discussoes<&#47;a>:<&#47;em></p>
<p>Um artigo na <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.prospect-magazine.co.uk&#47;article_details.php?id=7795">Prospect<&#47;a> (bolds e italicos meus):</p>
<blockquote><p>David Cameron says, "It's time we admitted that there's more to life than money, and it's time we focused not just on GDP, but on GWB&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;General Wellbeing," by which he means happiness.</p>
<p>[...]<br />
However, Cameron's contrast implies that increased GWB might have to come at the expense of GDP growth and economic liberalisation. Yet if you really profess to care about happiness, you must care about economic freedom and economic growth too. Our happiness depends on them more than almost anything else.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>A recent study of the self-reported happiness of almost 400,000 subjects in the OECD countries [...] shows that while <strong>no single variable has a whoppingly large positive impact on average happiness over time, none, other than life expectancy, has a larger effect than GDP per head<&#47;strong>. If becoming richer does not boost happiness, then, according to the statistics, neither does reducing unemployment, increasing welfare benefits, or&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; anything.</p>
<p>An even more comprehensive 2006 study [...] indicates that GDP per capita has a relatively modest positive effect on happiness, while GDP per capita growth is a somewhat larger boon. Most strikingly, Takashima and Ovaska show that <strong>"economic freedom"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;a measure of "personal choice, freedom to compete and the security of privately owned property as its core components"&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;trumps all other variables [in predicting happiness]<&#47;strong>. On the other hand, according to Ovaska and Takashima,<strong>"size of government" has a negative relationship to happiness<&#47;strong>. <em>Happiness-based policy looks more like Thatcherism every day<&#47;em>.<&#47;blockquote><br />
