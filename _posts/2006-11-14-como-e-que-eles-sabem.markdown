<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <em>isto j&Atilde;&iexcl; parece um blogue<&#47;em>:<br />
Vers&Atilde;&pound;o abreviada duma cr&Atilde;&sup3;nica que vale a pena ler <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theregister.co.uk&#47;2006&#47;11&#47;08&#47;guilty_associations&#47;">na &Atilde;&shy;ntegra<&#47;a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>How frightened would you be if you were secretly planning to get pregnant, without telling your husband, and discovered that someone had written to him telling him about it? Or, put the other way, how would you feel if you discovered your wife was pregnant only when someone dropped you a letter?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The story, summarised, is that Sainsbury's was spending an absurd amount of money sending people promotional coupons, money-off special offers [...]</p>
<p>The trouble was simple: they were sending girly shampoo promotions to households with six rugby-playing male students [...] Not profitable stuff.</p>
<p>[The IT Department came to help by looking at buying patterns]</p>
<p>[T]he patterns might show quite clearly that 5,000 people bought something called "product A" and "product B" and "product C" and went on to buy "product D" three weeks later. So if you can dig out all the people who bought A, B and C but have not yet bought D, and mail them, you're clearly looking at a common pattern. So drop them a discount voucher for D!</p>
<p>And D turns out to be baby clothes, and the man of the household is vastly amused: "Darling, look at this! Those idiots at Sainsbury's are sending us baby clothes vouchers! As if we would want to start a family!" - and she says, turning pink and coughing: "Dear, I've been meaning to tell you, I've missed my last period..."</p>
<p>And this actually happened. As you can imagine, the angry letters poured in: "Who told you...!?" and the project was subtly modified.<&#47;blockquote><br />
Segunda Parte:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Great!" you say. "This means that the enforcement people can actually anticipate terrorist acts? Spot potential terrorists before they even realise they're on the path to mayhem?"</p>
<p>No. Not terrorists, just enemies. Hostile journalists, campaigning lobbyists, critical journalists, businessmen who are likely to sponsor rival parties, people who oppose the party leader's favourite idea of the year.</p>
<p>You, yourself, possibly don't realise where you're heading. They do. They can now take action, as appropriate. [T]hey could, of course, target you for a hearts and minds educational campaign so that you see things from a better point of view. Or it could be hostility: arrange a Customs or VAT inspection, or start a smear campaign, or search aggressively for accounting irregularities.</p>
<p>All based on guilt by association. They may not know exactly what is in your heart. But they know who you associate with, and what other people are doing who went down that path.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>But does it matter? Frankly, the more I think about what this data mining makes possible, the more I realise it needs specific legislation, not just making it a crime to provide this sort of data to government, but making it forbidden for governments to keep.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Don't worry about Google giving your geographical position away to corner shop coffee sellers. Worry about the governments, who will have tools of oppression that make simple Stalinesque brutality look like freedom, and who will make "pre-crime" a reality.<&#47;blockquote></p>
