<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <em>h&Atilde;&iexcl; coment&Atilde;&iexcl;rios que d&Atilde;&pound;o posts<&#47;em>:</p>
<p>I haven't read Dawkins's book, <cite>The God Delusion<&#47;cite> yet, but I have read interviews and opinion pieces both about and by him. I also consider myself an agnotheist, i.e. i believe Probability("God Exists") to be small, but greater than zero. I think the problem is that Dawkins spends too much time debating christians and not enough time debating reasonable atheists (or even agnotheists [which he claims to be], or agnostics).</p>
<p>The problem with Dawkins's thesis is that it is a thesis of intolerance. Not the fact that he argues that god doesn't exist, but the fact that he is intolerant towards others is the problem.</p>
<p>Even in secular Europe, superstitions are rampant and people would protest heavily against being forced out of them (try arguing in Germany for genetic modification of foods, or outlawing <cite>alternative medicine<&#47;cite> as the junk-medicine it is: you will get violence in the streets).</p>
<p>New-age humbug is just as humbuggy as traditional church humbug. To be fair, Dawkins decries both. But some of those who most speak out against church involvement in our society are those who would like to use state taxes for bullshit like homeopathic "treatments". And those societies (or communities in a society) who are less attached to the traditional church, are those most accepting of new-age b.s. &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; religion and superstition will not go away, it will only change its name and guise, according to intellectual fashion.</p>
<p>None of this is a new phenomenon. Back in the day, after the French Revolution, the original jacobines founded their own b.s.-religions based on pseudo-scientific theories on the mystic powers of gravitation and skull measurements.</p>
