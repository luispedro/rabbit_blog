<p>No <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nytimes.com&#47;2007&#47;03&#47;05&#47;business&#47;05oil1.html">New York Times<&#47;a>:<br />
<blockquote>BAKERSFIELD, Calif. - The Kern River oil field, discovered in 1899, was revived when Chevron engineers here started injecting high-pressured steam to pump out more oil. The field, whose <strong>production had slumped to 10,000 barrels a day in the 1960s, now has a daily output of 85,000 barrels<&#47;strong>.
<p>In Indonesia, Chevron has applied the same technology to the giant Duri oil field, discovered in 1941, <strong>boosting production there to more than 200,000 barrels a day, up from 65,000 barrels in the mid-1980s<&#47;strong>.
<p>[...]
<p>In 1978, when he started his career here, operators believed the field would be abandoned within 15 years. "That's why peak oil is a moving target," Mr. Hatlen said. "Oil is always a function of price and technology."<&#47;blockquote></p>
