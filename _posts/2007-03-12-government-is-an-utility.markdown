<p>P. J. O'Rourke:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Sovies were firmly rooted in the abstract, had both their feet planted on the air. It was impossible to get them to understand that <em>government isn't a philosophical concept, it's a utility, a service industry<&#47;em> --- a way to get road built and Iraqis killed.<&#47;blockquote><br />
Isto foi escrito em 1991, portanto a Guerra do Iraque era outra...</p>
