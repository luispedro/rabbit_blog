<p>P J O'Rourke<&#47;p>:<br />
<blockquote>What  does the President do? He provides leadership, but I don't know what that means. [...] Leadership presupposes that we, as a nation, are all going someplace together. I haven't noticed that we're going anywhere lately. And this is a free country, anyway --- each of us should choose his own destination.<&#47;blockquote></p>
