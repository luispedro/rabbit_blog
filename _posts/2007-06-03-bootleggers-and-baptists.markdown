<p>Ultimamente, o meu iPod tem estado cheio do <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.econtalk.org">econtalk<&#47;a>, um podcast de economia com um ponto de vista libert&Atilde;&iexcl;rio.</p>
<p>A qualidade tende a ser boa, mas com varia&Atilde;&sect;&Atilde;&micro;es. Este foi muito interessante:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.econtalk.org&#47;archives&#47;2007&#47;01&#47;bruce_yandle_on.html">Bootleggers and Baptists<&#47;a>:<br />
<blockquote>Here is the essence of the theory: durable social regulation evolves when it is demanded by both of two distinctly different groups. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Baptists&acirc;&euro; point to the moral high ground and give vital and vocal endorsement of laudable public bene&iuml;&not;ts promised by a desired regulation. Baptists &iuml;&not;&sbquo;ourish when their moral message forms a visible foundation for political action. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Bootleggers&acirc;&euro; are much less visible but no less vital. Bootleggers, who expect to pro&iuml;&not;t from the very regulatory restrictions desired by Baptists, grease the political machinery with some of their expected proceeds. They are simply in it for the money.</p>
<p>The theory&acirc;&euro;&trade;s name draws on colorful tales of states&acirc;&euro;&trade; efforts to regulate alcoholic beverages by banning Sunday sales at legal outlets. Baptists fervently endorsed such actions on moral grounds. Bootleggers tolerated the actions gleefully because their effect was to limit competition.<br />
