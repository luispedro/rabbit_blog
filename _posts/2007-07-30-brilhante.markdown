<p>Este novo <a href="http:&#47;&#47;biologistshelpingbookstores.blogspot.com&#47;">blogue<&#47;a>:<br />
<blockquote>I'm not sure if you've noticed, but some bookstores seem to have a little problem discerning science from non-science.  I'm specifically talking about biology books vs. creationist books.  Sometimes, you will find pseudo-scientific rubbish such as "intelligent design" books next to such authors as Darwin, Mayr, Gould, et al.</p>
<p>Now, before you get all worked-up and charge into your local bookstore demanding to see the manager, pause to realise just how successful creationism has been in blurring the lines of what science actually is in the public's eye.  So successful, in fact, that books whose main argument is that "God did it" enjoy shelf-space with some of the finest minds ever to grace humanity.</p>
<p>This is unacceptable, and something must be done.  Booksellers are not scientists, maybe we shouldn't expect them to be able to discern between science and books desperately trying to wrap themselves in scientific credibility.  I, however, am a scientist - and I can clearly see when an error has been made when stocking the shelves of the science section.</p>
<p>It is my mission to correctly re-shelve books to the appropriate section of the bookstore.  </p>
<p>For example, "Darwin's Black Box", the famous pseudo-science book by the non-evolutionary non-scientist Michael Behe, should not be in the "Evolutionary Biology" section, but something more appropriate, such as "New Age", "Religion", "Christianity", or even "Fiction".  You get the idea.</p>
<p>I call on all readers of this blog to follow my example.  Help your local bookstore correctly stock their science section.  Spread the word.<&#47;blockquote></p>
