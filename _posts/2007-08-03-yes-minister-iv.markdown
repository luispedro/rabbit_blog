<p>Minister: What if the report is unfavourable to us?<br />
Humphrey: Then, we don't publish it.<br />
Minister: You mean suppress it?<br />
Humphrey: Of course not. We just don't publish it.<br />
Minister: What's the difference.<br />
Humphrey: Suppression is done by totalitarian states; we take a democratic decision not to publish.</p>
