<p>Minister: I read the brief already, on the plane.<br />
Humphrey: Oh, what did it say?<br />
Minister: Well, it's so hard to concentrate on airplanes, you know? People keep serving you drinks or waking you up.<br />
Humphrey: Yes, minister, it is hard to concentrate if you keep being woken up.</p>
