<p>Minister: But can we stop the BBC from broadcasting a show that's bad for us. Surely, we cannot censor them.<br />
Humphrey: We cannot censor them. But maybe we can convince them stop not broadcast something if it is not in the public interest.<br />
Minister: Well, it is not in my interest. And I represent the public, don't I?</p>
