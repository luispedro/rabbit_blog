    que o governo lhes pague, mas o sentido de entitlement que este casal tem que
    acha que tem um direito a viver &Atilde;&nbsp; custa de quem trabalha.

<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <em>posts roubados<&#47;em>:</p>
<p>No <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.economist.com&#47;blogs&#47;certainideasofeurope&#47;2007&#47;08&#47;not_economist_subscribers_pres.cfm">blogue do economist<&#47;a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the English-language news website, The Local, the couple have had their benefits reduced by the &Atilde;&ndash;terg&Atilde;&para;tland county court, despite a moving plea from one of the pair:</p>
<blockquote><p>    "In a letter to the county court, the husband had argued for a reversal of the decision taken by local social services at the end of May to reduce the couple's benefits.</p>
<p>    "Conventional work is out of the question for me - both in terms of my conscience and on an intellectual level - as it seems objectionable with regard to both my personal well-being and the well-being of society as a whole. Emotionally too it creates unbearable pain and dejection," he wrote."<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>The couple's benefits have not been cut off completely. Though to their chagrin they may be forced to leave their current country home, and rent a cheaper property in a more built-up area, this despite noting that they do not thrive in the "atmosphere" of towns.<&#47;blockquote></p>
