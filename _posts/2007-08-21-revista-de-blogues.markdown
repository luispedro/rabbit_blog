<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <i>and now, for something completely different<&#47;i>:</p>
<p>O <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.overcomingbias.com&#47;">overcoming bias<&#47;a> &Atilde;&copy; um dos melhores blogues que a&Atilde;&shy; anda. Consegue fazer filosofia decentezinha num blogue.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.overcomingbias.com&#47;2007&#47;08&#47;media-risk-bias.html">Hoje<&#47;a>, escreve isto:</p>
<blockquote><p>There exists a feedback loop in cases like this. The public is concerned about a possible health threat (electromagnetic emissions, aspartame, GMOs) and demand that the potential threat is evaluated. Funding appears and researchers evaluate the threat. Their findings are reported back through media to the public, who update their risk estimates.</p>
<p>In an ideal world the end result is that everybody get better estimates. But this process very easily introduces bias: the initial concern will determine where the money goes, so issues the public is concerned about will get more funding regardless of where the real risks are. The media reporting will also introduce bias since the media favour reporting newsworthy news, and risk tends to cause greater interest than reports of no risk (or the arrival of reviews of the state of the knowledge). Hence studies warning of a risk will be overreported compared to risks downplaying it, and this will lead to a biased impression of the total risk. Finally, the public will have an availability bias that makes them take note of reported risks more than reported non-risks. And this leads to further concerns and demands for investigation.<&#47;blockquote></p>
