<p>Na s&Atilde;&copy;rie <i>isto j&Atilde;&iexcl; parece um blogue<&#47;i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Certain professionals, while believing they are experts, are in fact not. Based on their empirical record, they do not know more about their subject matter than the general population, but they are much better at narrating---or, worse at smoking you with complicated mathematical models. They are also more likely to wear a tie.</p>
<p>-- N. Taleb, The Black Swan.<&#47;blockquote></p>
