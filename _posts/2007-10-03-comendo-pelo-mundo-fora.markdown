<p>No imperd&Atilde;&shy;vel <cite>Discover Your Inner Economist<&#47;cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The presence of a wealthy class of people, all other things equal, is good for food because the wealthy are a strong market for a tasty meal. [... But] a certain amount of poverty is, sad to say, likely to produce gourmet meals. [...] So the committed foodie should look to regions where some people are very rich and others very poor.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Para mim, isto (entre outros) explica porque &Atilde;&copy; que o Brasil &Atilde;&copy; o melhor s&Atilde;&shy;tio onde j&Atilde;&iexcl; comi.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Anglo-American nations [USA, Canada, UK, Australia, New-Zealand], all have relatively free labour markets and immigration policies. Thirty of forty years ago, these countries were culinary losers. Today they are all up-and-coming, gaining on the older culinary reputation of France. Many restaurants---whether haute cuisine or ethnic dining---in the Anglo-American are staffed and run by immigrants.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Tamb&Atilde;&copy;m confirma a minha experi&Atilde;&ordf;ncia da &Atilde;&ordm;ltima vez que fui ao Reino Unido: come-se inesperadamente bem.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not unusual for a French chef to move to NY, hire Mexicans to cook French food for an American clientele. [...] The Mexicans are the reason why the French chef is serving French food to French tourists near Lincoln Centre rather than in Lyon.<&#47;blockquote></p>
