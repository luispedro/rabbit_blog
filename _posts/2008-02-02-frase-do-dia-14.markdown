<p><cite> European conservatives should, like many of their American cousins, hope not only for an Obama nomination, but also for his election on November 4th.

But Obama could change that; a charismatic and broadly supported president with ideas similar to Burkean philosophy would lend credibility to conservatism everywhere.<&#47;cite></p>
