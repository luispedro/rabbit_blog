<p>Ser&Atilde;&iexcl; que Chipre do Norte &Atilde;&copy; a Cuba da UE?</p>
<blockquote><p>One [cannot] reasonably try to starve a nation into changing its mind, let alone one that threatens nobody. The EU doesn't try that with Iran or North Korea, still less Cuba. It does try with the Turkish-Cypriots.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>But there's a wider objection too. What right has any government, facing no risk of war and for no humanitarian end, to forbid its citizens to buy and sell, to borrow or lend, where they choose? To travel as they choose? Putin's Russia is ostentatiously hostile to my country [Britain]. It sends its thugs to murder British residents. It could wipe out the lot of us in ten minutes. So do we embargo dealings with Russia? Far from it: British and all other EU firms are free to hurl billions into the Russian economy, to import trillions of cubic feet of Russian gas. So who do we embargo? A wretched little would-be friendly would-be state at the far end of the Mediterranean, for wretched little would-be reasons. <&#47;blockquote></p>
