  content: E o mais impressionante &Atilde;&copy; que, por raz&Atilde;&micro;es sobretudo
    ideol&Atilde;&sup3;gicas, esse senhor &Atilde;&copy; apoiado por diversos governantes,
    do Brasil inclusive. Ningu&Atilde;&copy;m ousa critic&Atilde;&iexcl;-lo, nem sequer
    question&Atilde;&iexcl;-lo. Uma corja!

<p>&Atilde;&permil; t&Atilde;&pound;o previs&Atilde;&shy;vel que &Atilde;&copy; triste. Um relato da Venezuela chavista:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider breakfast. My breakfast, to be exact. It's been months since I have had an oatmeal breakfast or a nice cup of espresso with a drop of milk because coffee and milk has literally vanished from supermarkets' shelves since last November. And that includes "Mercal", the government's supermarket network where the poor are supposed to buy food at subsidized low prices </p>
<p> The reason? Stiff price controls, of course, and fixed currency rates that have been going on for 5 years, too.</p>
