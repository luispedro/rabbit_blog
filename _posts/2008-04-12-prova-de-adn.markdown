<blockquote>Seven years ago, a teenage girl was raped, and she described her attacker as "black, large and tall." So why did police recently arrest Mark Minick, a white, thin, short man? Britain's national DNA database linked him to a hair found on the girl while she was lying in a hospital bed. He says police told him they had airtight evidence against him, never mentioning he didn't come close to matching the description of the rapist. It turns out Minick worked at the hospital, moving beds, when the girl was taken there, and that's how his hair may have gotten on her. Prosecutors dropped charges against Minick at trial, after he had spent several months on house arrest.</p>
