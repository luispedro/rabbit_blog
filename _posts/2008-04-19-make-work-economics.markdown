<blockquote>We live in an age of "policy wonks" who judge [policy] programs by their effects on productivity, or output, or work effort. Wokian analysis uses the jargon of economics while ignoring its content. Economists view the wonks' fixation on output as a bizarre and unhealthy obsession. Wonks want Americans to die rich; economists want Americans to die happy.</p>
