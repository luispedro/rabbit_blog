<p>No <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.overcomingbias.com&#47;2008&#47;05&#47;science-doesnt.html">overcoming bias<&#47;a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
It furthermore seems to me that there is a deep analogy between (small-'l') libertarianism and Science:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both are based on a pragmatic distrust of reasonable-sounding arguments.</p>
<li>Both try to build systems that are more trustworthy than the people in them.
<li>Both accept that people are flawed, and try to harness their flaws to power the system.<&#47;ol>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The core argument for libertarianism is not that libertarianism would work in a perfect world, but that it degrades gracefully into real life.  Or rather, degrades less awkwardly than any other known economic principle.  (People who see Libertarianism as the perfect solution for perfect people, strike me as kinda missing the point of the "pragmatic distrust" thing.)<&#47;blockquote></p>
