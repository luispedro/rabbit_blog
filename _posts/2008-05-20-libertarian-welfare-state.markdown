<p>Vinda da Su&Atilde;&copy;cia, um pa&Atilde;&shy;s onde o sistema de pens&Atilde;&micro;es &Atilde;&copy; privado, as escolas funcionam com um sistema cheque-ensino:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Growing old in Sweden has become a dismal affair. Despite paying some of the world's highest taxes their entire working lives and living in one of the most generous welfare states, the old are increasingly being left stranded in their houses or forced to live in crumbling state-owned homes with dormitory-style accommodation and nothing to do but wonder where the famed Swedish model went wrong.</p>
<p>But an innovative private- sector plan for the provision of care to Sweden's elderly is promising to breathe some life into this arthritic corner of the Nordic welfare model.</p>
<p>Peje Emilsson, the man behind one of the country's most successful chains of voucher schools, is planning next year to launch a voucher-based elderly care service, provisionally called Silver Life.</p>
