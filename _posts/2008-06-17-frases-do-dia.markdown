<blockquote>I'm enough of a cultural relativist to believe that other cultures have a perfect right not to adopt American values, but enough of a cultural hegemonist to know that I want my country to maintain the dominant American culture. I will be thrilled to have new generations of immigrants contributing their music, their food, their religion, their community life--but I do not want them contributing their ideas about the rule of law, or indeed, what constitutes acceptable behavior in a queue.</p>
