WHO KNEW? The French Europe minister, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, has declared that American neo-conservatives bear much of the blame for the Irish no vote to the Lisbon Treaty. Speaking to a pro-European jamboree in Lyons on June 21st, Mr Jouyet (a former aide to Jacques Delors recruited by Mr Sarkozy for his knowledge of the corridors of Brussels power), offered the following thought:</p>
<p>    "The fight for Europe is not over, Europe has powerful enemies with deep pockets, as we have seen during the Irish referendum. They come not from Europe, but from the other side of the Atlantic."</p>
<p>    "The role of the American neo-conservatives in the Irish referendum was very important," he went on, to applause. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.economist.com&#47;blogs&#47;certainideasofeurope&#47;2008&#47;06&#47;frances_minister_sees_a_neocon.cfm">economist blog<&#47;a><&#47;blockquote></p>
