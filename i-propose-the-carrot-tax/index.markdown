<p>Being a rabbit, the free carrot market poses me a great problem since carrots are the basis of my meals. Therefore I propose a <i>one cent tax on each kilo of carrots sold<&#47;i>.</p>
<p>This is absurd, of course. My question is: Could I make it real? </p>
<p>No, not alone. But if I was a <i>Rabbit Association<&#47;i> I bet I could. Afterall, who would oppose me? If you think about it, one cent per kilo of carrots is not very bothersome. How many kilo of carrots did you buy last year? I'd say about ten, so you'd have paid ten cents more. Of course, given that there are about 250 million people in the US or Europe, that would make a reasonable income of 25 million - more than enough for a small organization and its lobbyist to live on.</p>
<p>This is a pattern I see everywhere. Very interested parties make each one of us lose a very small right (little more than a little annoyance) because it is very profitable for them. They lobby intensely on a very small legislative detail which noone really notices and noone really cares. Taxes and state financial backing of projects are the obvious example but another known example would be the whole copyright extension debate which is hot in some internet circles and completely unknown to most people who even when you explain it to them do not get very interested and it is completely untalked about in Europe. Some might take offense that people don't seem to care, but in a way they are right: it is not that important for most people. Yes, it means you pay a little bit more for old music, films and books and there is a lot of things you cannot do. But it is just a bit more, it doesn't really represent a big thing and when was the last time you wanted to publish a book which takes Disney characters without authorization from Disney Corp. Some artists get frustrated, but not really very important since other artists take all the copyright protection they can. The only single entity very affected by this are the big copyright holding companies who win massively while the rest of us lose lit bit. Another examples would be the way that big companies are massively protected in Europe (and probably the US as well). I mean, do you really mind if your flight or telephone bill or whatever is just that 10% more expensive and who cares about ISPs who block UDP ports for VoIP (does anyone outside geekworld even understand what that means?).</p>
<p>So I want to profit myself: I seek others who would lobby with me for a <i>carrot tax<&#47;i>. Just one cent for a kilo of carrots is not going to hurt anyone, is it?</p>
